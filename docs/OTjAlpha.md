OTjAlpha
========

At first startup it creates local user account data(keys) in ~~**./client**~~`./alpha_client` folder and register it at localhost server.

Than you can receive ~~silver grams~~ kactechLOCs from **OTjFaucet**, go to [#opentransactions](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#opentransactions) and call `OTjFaucet:` for details.

You can also send mails to other nyms!

**REMEMBER** if you want to run multiple instances of **OTjAlpha** on one machine- run them in separate directories!
